## 🌍 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index

### Objective
To empirically test the **Law of One Price** by using the Big Mac Index as a proxy for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) across international currencies.

---

### Methodology
- Constructed a country-level dataset using publicly available **2015 Big Mac Index** price data from *The Economist*.
- Converted raw local-currency burger prices into **implied PPP exchange rates** relative to the U.S. dollar.
- Compared implied PPP rates to observed market exchange rates to measure **currency misalignment**.
- Quantified the degree of **overvaluation or undervaluation** for each currency as a percentage deviation from parity.

---

### Key Findings
The analysis revealed persistent deviations from Purchasing Power Parity across countries, consistent with well-documented frictions in international markets. For example, the results indicate that **[insert currency, e.g., the Norwegian Krone] was overvalued by approximately [X%] relative to the U.S. dollar**, while several emerging-market currencies appeared substantially undervalued.

These misalignments suggest that **arbitrage is incomplete in practice**, reflecting the influence of non-tradable inputs, local cost structures, trade barriers, and pricing power. Overall, the findings reinforce the interpretation of PPP as a **long-run benchmark rather than a short-run equilibrium condition**.
