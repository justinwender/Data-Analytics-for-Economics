# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio for **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**.  
This repository showcases my coursework, labs, and applied projects at the intersection of **economic theory, causal inference, and modern data science**.

## 👋 About Me

I am a graduate economics student with a strong interest in **economic consulting, applied analytics, and data-driven policy analysis**. My academic focus centers on bridging the gap between:

- **Traditional economic reasoning** (theory, identification, interpretation), and  
- **Modern empirical tools** (machine learning, scalable computation, and predictive modeling).

This portfolio reflects my effort to translate economic intuition into **reproducible, data-backed analysis** using industry-relevant tools.

## 📁 About This Portfolio

This repository hosts my **coursework and labs for ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**.

### Course Philosophy: Concept Extension

The course follows a **Concept Extension** approach:
- We begin with foundational statistical and econometric tools (e.g., linear regression, hypothesis testing).
- We then *extend* these concepts using machine learning methods (e.g., **Lasso, regularization, cross-validation**) to handle higher-dimensional data and real-world complexity.

Throughout the course, I focus on:
- Combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Understanding the **tradeoffs between interpretability and performance**
- Applying economic logic to guide model selection and evaluation

The goal is not just to build models, but to **ask the right economic questions of the data**.
